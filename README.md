# GPT3-API-Flask-Python_Chat_Website
Utilize OpenAI GPT-3 API to build a python flask-based website
Here is my Chinese blog about the Install Guidance: http://t.csdn.cn/aH3y4

Python3 Environment:

1. Install openai and flask library

pip install openai

pip install flask


2. In main.py file replace code openai.api_key = 'your API' with your API key


3. Run the python file and use your browser open 127.0.0.1:80 or localhost

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< Update >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

As you can see the previous version of website (main.py + chat.html) is quite shaby. 

So, I asked chatGPT kindly for a better design and proposed three improving requirements:

1. Seperate the original html file into three standard files (html + css + js) and keep all the functions at the same time.
2. Redesign the website using Bootstrap templates.
3. The Temperature Guide Section will be able to click and hide on the right side of the website.

Here is the comparison of the original website and the chatGPT improved website.
